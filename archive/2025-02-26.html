                <h3>About This Selection</h3>
                <p>"Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat" is a 1982 album by Indian musician Charanjit Singh that uniquely blends traditional Indian ragas with electronic disco music. Utilizing instruments like the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, TR-808 drum machine, and Jupiter-8 synthesizer, Singh crafted a sound that many consider a precursor to acid house music, predating the genre's rise in the late 1980s. Initially overlooked, the album gained recognition in the 21st century for its innovative fusion of classical Indian music and electronic dance rhythms.</p>

                    <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
                    <p>Charanjit Singh was a session musician in the Bollywood film industry when he created this groundbreaking album. His experimental approach to combining traditional Indian ragas with Western electronic dance music was revolutionary for its time, yet the album remained in obscurity until it was rediscovered and reissued in 2010.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes this work particularly remarkable is how Singh independently arrived at sonic textures and techniques that would later define acid house music, seemingly isolated from the Chicago and Detroit scenes where that genre would officially emerge years later. The album stands as a fascinating example of parallel innovation and the global nature of musical development.</p>
